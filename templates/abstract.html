							<p>Heart attacks remain a major global health challenge, making timely and accurate risk prediction essential for effective prevention and clinical decision-making. In this study, we present an efficient and accurate heart attack risk prediction system based on machine learning techniques. The proposed system employs multiple classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes, and Decision Tree. To enhance predictive performance, several feature selection methods—Relief, Minimal Redundancy Maximal Relevance, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, and Local Learning—are utilized to remove irrelevant and redundant features. Additionally, we introduce a novel feature selection algorithm, Fast Conditional Mutual Information Maximization (FCMIM), designed to address the feature selection problem more effectively. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation is used to ensure robust model evaluation and optimal hyperparameter tuning. Performance metrics are applied to assess classifier effectiveness on the selected feature sets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FCMIM algorithm, when combined with a Support Vector Machine classifier, yields superior accuracy for heart attack risk prediction compared to existing methods. The findings indicate that the proposed FCMIM-SVM–based system is a promising and practical solution for early identification of heart attack risk in healthcare settings.</p>
